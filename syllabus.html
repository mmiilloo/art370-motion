Syllabus<br><br>

Purpose:<br>
The purpose of this studio-based course is to explore how the conventions of print typography
and the dynamics of word-image relationships change with the introduction of time, motion
and sound. There will be a sequence of problems of increasing length and complexity, often with a
personal choice of subject matter. Most weeks we will spend part of our class period looking at
selected film and video examples and discussing how they work.<br><br>
Working in time-based media opens up new opportunities for expressiveness and clarity of
communications. Projects will focus on the controlled interaction of words and images to express an
idea or tell a story. The work in this course is an extension of graphic design and, as such, the
communication objective will be more explicit than in work that might be thought of as “movies”
or “art videos.”<br><br>

While projects will center on linear narrative forms, the issues we will discuss will be anticipating the
unique features of non-linear and interactive media you will work with in the next semester:
engagement, action and feedback, orientation and navigation, and the special character of non-linear
narrative forms.<br><br>

The projects you will work on have been designed to expose you to specific qualities of time-based
design and to build on one another. Each will be framed with certain constraints and frequently with a
personal choice of content. The goal is to experience first hand the communications potential of
relatively short-form, time-based design work, and to become familiar with choreographing images,
text and sounds through selection, editing and juxtaposition. Introductory instruction will be supplied
to familiarize you with Aftereffects, the software that you will be primarily using.
<hr>

Class structure:<br>
This is an intensive studio-based class, so evidence of learning is primarily in the design of motion
pieces and their discussion. As well as developing the skill of making, it is important to develop a critical
vocabulary to discuss the work one-on-one as well as in a group setting. You will be asked to explain
(constructively) what you understood from a work made by your classmates, and, for your own work,
to be able to explain your intention, the formal choices you made to support that intention,
and why you chose them. For some classes you will also be asked to research motion examples (within
certain criteria) that you select as exemplary, and to explain how the way a piece was made supports its
content. We will alternate between working sessions with one-on-one discussions, and group discussions
of finished work. Some projects may have assigned readings or viewings.<br><br>

Class Format<br>
Because of the health constraints posed by the coronavirus, our course will be conducted primarily
on-line using ZOOM. Fortunately, because our media is video and sound, the on-line format will not be
as disruptive as with courses that are dependent on work that is primarily physical and on paper. In our
case, screen-based work can be shared and critiqued in its own medium. Being virtual also presents the
potential of more teacher/student contact because it will not be limited to one four-hour studio visit.
A typical class will start all together, and then break into 1: or small-group discussions. In the case of
students who may not be able to be in New Haven, special consideration will be made to accommodate
different time zones as necessary. We will set up an on-line repository for all your work, both drafts and
final results, as well as for presentation materials prepared for the course.<br><br>

Our on-line format will allow us take advantage of inviting more distant visitors to participate in our
class discussions. I will also arrange individual “Office Hours” for those who request it, to answer questions,
learn more about your wider range of work and your personal interests and goals as designers.
Our TA, Milo, works in the Graduate Studio and is available for questions you might have between
classes: milo.boinacci@yale.edu. He will be giving you instruction on our principle software.
On the second floor, immediately outside the atrium, is The Digital Technology Office, where Sarah
Stevens-Morling (sarah.stevens-morling@yale.edu) and Anahita Vossoughi (anahita.vossoughi@yale.
edu) can also be of assistance with technical issues. Equipment rental is also available on site.

Course requirements:<br>
<ol>
    <li>This course is required for Preliminary Year students in the MFA Program,but also open to
    Yale College students.</li>

    <li>For Yale College students, Art 265, Typography in Graphic Design is a required prerequisite; Art 367,
    Intermediate Graphic Design is recommend; or by permission. Where space is limited, preference
    will be given to Seniors.</li>

    <li>You are expected to attend and be prepared at every class. Your presence and active participation
    are essential to the success of the course.</li>

    <li>Each project is due at its assigned final group crit and discussion, and on the server before class starts.</li>
</ol>


<hr>

Evaluation:<br>
Your work will be evaluated on the basis of:
<ul class="indent">
    <li>Your finished motion pieces for the projects</li>
    <li>Your active participation in class discussions and presentations</li>
    <li>Your design process in moving from an idea through refinement to a resolved project</li>
    <li>Your ability to process and utilize critiques from faculty and from your classmates</li>
</ul>
